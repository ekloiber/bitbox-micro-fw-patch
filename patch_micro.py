"""
Patch bitbox micro 2.3.4: MIDI control of things only the encoders reach.

Two voice classes handle per-pad Control Change, each with its own struct
layout, stack frame and return target. Both are hooked.

  class A  FUN_080b10b8   Sample, Granular
  class B  FUN_080b74ec   Clip, Slicer

A multi-sample pad is a Sample pad with a folder loaded into it, so it is
class A too. Looper is neither, and has no FX sends at all.

Also rewrites the startup splash: line 2 stops crediting 1010music, and the
version is marked as a modified build.

Usage: patch_micro.py <in.bin> <out.bin> [version]

#
# 2026-09-05: `2.3.7-mod-b10` is thirteen characters and was read back off the
# module as `2.3.7-mod-b1`, which is exactly twelve. Every earlier EQ build was
# twelve or fewer (`2.3.7-mod-b7`) and read correctly. That cost real time: two
# hardware faults were reported against "B1" and had to be traced back to which
# image was actually on the card before either could be investigated.
#
# One observation is not a specification, so this limit is NOT set at the
# observed edge. Ten characters leaves two to spare against the only evidence we
# have, and `2.3.7-b10` fits in nine -- so the scheme from b11 onward drops the
# `-mod` infix, which the `community fw` line above already says.
#
# CONFIRMED END TO END ON HARDWARE, 2026-09-05. b11 is the first build in the
# nine-character scheme and its splash was read back in full -- "all characters,
# nothing cut". String chosen, guard enforced here at build time, legible on the
# panel. But read the evidence for what it is: ONE build at NINE characters
# displaying fully proves nine fits. It does not measure the panel, so 10 is
# still a conservative choice made from a single truncation observation rather
# than a measured limit. Do not raise it on the strength of b11.

# --- granular parameters -------------------------------------------------
# The five Gran-page controls the module will not let you modulate. The manual
# marks them "Mod Target? No" and they have no three-box indicator on the
# device, so the hardware encoder is the only thing that reaches them. Speed is
# absent deliberately: it IS modulatable and MIDI Learn binds it fine.
#
# These are NOT written directly. Each parameter's setter does real work --
# Scatter indexes a lookup table, Grain Size clamps against 0x348, Window
# calls a converter and offsets by 0x100, Density triggers a recompute -- so
# reimplementing any of it would be five chances to be subtly wrong.
#
# Instead the hook lands in the firmware's own code. The per-pad CC handler and
# the set-parameter handler are the SAME function sharing one stack frame, and
# every parameter case reads its value from the same slot the CC arrives in
# ([sp,#0x40]) and exits via the same branch. So an arm only has to rescale the
# value in place and jump to the case. The firmware does the rest, including
# the recompute, exactly as it does for the encoder.
#
# Posting a set-parameter message instead would deadlock: the queue blocks past
# 32 entries and this function is both producer and consumer.
# case entry -> first instruction there, checked before we trust the address
# Every case we jump into, with the first four bytes found there in stock
# 2.3.4. These are branches into the middle of a function, so landing on the
# wrong instruction would corrupt a pad rather than fail cleanly -- the patcher
# checks each site before writing anything.

# Class A can branch into a case because its CC handler and its setter are one

# dispatched, so there is no case to jump into and no static caller to copy.
#
# Calling it is possible because its argument surface is tiny -- across the
# whole switch it reads param_2+0x18, param_3+0xc (the parameter id) and
# param_3+0x10 (the value), and nothing else. param_4 is touched by two cases
# we do not use.
#
# The two pointers are both live at the hook. FUN_080b74ec opens with
# "mov r4, r0" and "ldr.w sb, [r1]", so r4 is the voice and r9 is *param_2 --
# the same object class A calls iVar14 and reads its timestamp from. r9 is
# written once, in that prologue, and not again in the 748 instructions before
# the hook, so it still holds it when a CC arrives.
#
# This is how the three LFO controls are reached. Writing their fields by hand
# was the alternative and a bad one: each case ends by calling a resync
# (FUN_080ba214) that takes that timestamp, and without it the value lands
# somewhere the LFO never reads.

# --- the compressor (new in 2.3.6) ---------------------------------------
# The module has a compressor across Out 1 and 2. It ships, it works, and the
# only control the UI gives you is On/Off -- everything else is compiled in.
#
# Unlike every other control here, these are DIRECT FIELD WRITES. The
# compressor object has no set-parameter handler at all, so there is no setter
# to hand a value to. That is safe only because each field is consumed raw:
# the gain computer reads threshold and ratio out of the object every block,
# and nothing is derived or cached from them. See COMPRESSOR-DESIGN.md.
#
# The addresses are RAM, so they cannot be checked directly. Each one is
# instead proved by an instruction in the image that computes it, and those
# are guarded below -- an offset is only as trustworthy as its proof.
# The session is NOT at a fixed address. MANAGER is the engine; the session
# hangs off it as a POINTER, and everything the compressor needs is an offset
# from that pointer's target. Reading it at runtime is the only correct way --
# treating MANAGER as the session lands ~150 KB away, in memory belonging to
# something else entirely.
# CC 40 writes the on/off flag on the SESSION, which is allocated once at boot
# and is therefore a safe target. CCs 41-45 do NOT write the engine at all --
# they write the patch's own store, and hook E stamps that onto whichever
# compressor object the audio is actually processing, every block. That is what
# makes the values survive: hardware testing showed that a direct
# write to the compressor object is undone after a variable period.
# The compressor block listens on ONE channel, unlike every other patched
# global. CC 108-111 get away with answering on all sixteen because they sit in
# 102-119, which the MIDI spec genuinely leaves undefined. 40-45 do not: CC 32-63
# are the fine-adjust LSBs of CC 0-31, so CC 40 is formally the LSB of CC 8.
# Almost nothing sends those, which is why the range looked free -- but gear does
# help itself to the numbers, and a patched global consumes a CC on
# every channel. A stray CC 45 at value 0 sets makeup to -36 dB, which is silence
# and reads exactly like a firmware fault. Confirmed on hardware.

# The patch's own parameter store. Chosen from a 60 KB run of AXI SRAM with no
# literal references anywhere in the image, and below the two MPU regions at
# 0x24060000/0x24070000 which are configured for DMA. UNVERIFIED -- "no literal
# references" does not prove "not reached by pointer arithmetic". The magic word
# means a clobber degrades to the feature switching itself off rather than
# stamping garbage into the audio path. See COMPRESSOR-DESIGN.md milestone M1.
# Where the patch keeps its five parameters. This has to be memory the module
# does not use, and "no code mentions it" is NOT enough -- a heap hands out
# addresses it computes at runtime. Beta 4 put the store at 0x24054000, which
# is two-thirds of the way UP the heap; it worked until the heap grew into it,
# then allocations ate the tail of the store and the compressor went silent.
#
#   0x2402e128  heap start   \  malloc's own bounds, read out of its
#   0x24068aa8  heap end     /   literal pool at 0x080bcbe4 / 0x080bcbe0

#               above this is ever stack (vector table word 0)
#   0x24080000  end of AXI SRAM
#
# So the 93 KB above the stack pointer is above the heap AND above the stack.
# Nothing in the image references it, and a DMA engine cannot target a buffer
# whose address appears nowhere. The guards below pin all three boundaries, so

# Since the patch has to own these five values anyway, it may as well start
# somewhere useful: gentle bus glue. Every one stays adjustable, and the guide
# gives the numbers to put the stock voicing back on a button.
# Three of these five are literally SSL bus-compressor switch positions -- 2:1,
# 30 ms, 0.3 s -- which is the classic mix-glue setting. The threshold is the one
# the SSL does not give you a number for either: on that unit you turn it until
# the meter shows 2-4 dB of reduction. -12 dB puts us there at sensible levels,
# does less rather than more if the module is run cold, and cannot crush at 2:1
# even if it is badly wrong. Makeup stays at 0 dB so switching the compressor on
# can only ever reduce the level, never clip someone.

# NOT USED, and deliberately kept as a headstone. The whole DSP tail this arm
# used to carry -- buffer fetch, biquad, filter state, pole and finiteness
# tests -- existed because EQ-RE-FINDINGS.md concluded the stock EQ handler
# "never asks for the buffers ... that one call is the entire gap". It was
# wrong. The EQ's buffer fetch is 0x080a3228; the RE searched for the
# COMPRESSOR's 0x080a3288, one transposed digit away, did not find it, and
# invented a redundant DSP for us to write. The stock handler at 0x080bb504 is
# already a complete two-channel transposed-direct-form-II biquad, gated on the
# band's type at +0x10c and enable at +0x11c -- which is to say, gated on
# exactly the two fields `gsetband` writes.
#
# Worse than redundant: our biquad kept its state in the band's own state words
# at +0x54 and +0x5c, which is where the stock filter keeps ITS state. Two
# recursive filters sharing one state array inside the same block destroyed each
# other's history, and the master bus went silent whenever any band was enabled.
# Hardware-confirmed 2026-09-04: deleting our DSP made every mode and every
# control work. Do not reintroduce a per-sample loop here. Set parameters,
# chain to the stock handler, and let 1010music filter.

#
# Hook F bumps `gen` on every accepted CC. Hook G re-applies the whole mode on
# EVERY audio block, unconditionally, exactly as hook E stamps the compressor's
# store onto its live object every block.
#
# It used to apply only when `gen` differed from `agen`, and that economy gave
# away the property that makes hook E robust. `gen` tracks OUR intent; it says
# nothing about the state of the object. A preset load reconstructs the EQ
# object to constructor defaults while the store still says `agen == gen`, so
# the compare took its early exit forever and the object stayed configured by
# nobody -- audio passing, nothing happening, and structurally invisible to a
# null test, because failure exits to pass-through and pass-through is exactly
# what such a test expects.
#
# The cost of applying every block is BOUNDED, not assumed: 2,512 instructions
# and 5,444 cycles in a 1,280,000-cycle block, 0.43%. D-25's identity fill is
# what makes that tractable -- `gapply` designs exactly four bands on every

# Modes. mode = (7-bit value * 10) >> 7, so each of the ten slots is about 12.8
# encoder values wide. The controller sends ten steps over Min 6 / Max 122,
# which centres every step in its window with SIX values of margin either side
# -- the widest margin this design has ever had, because fewer modes means
# wider windows. A full 0..127 sweep would land a step within one value of a
# boundary, which is what made dialling a mode unreliable through b5.
#
# TWO NUMBERINGS, and every confusion in this feature has come from mixing
# them. The enum below is ZERO-based. The dial, and every table in
# EQ-CONTROL-LAYOUT.md, is ONE-based. Both columns are in the table so that
# neither document has to be translated in somebody's head.
#
# A push earns a CC only when it does something the controller cannot. The
# Drop's `Reset Mid` already gives instant neutral on any encoder, so a button
# that merely returns a control to its resting value is redundant. What
# survives is the momentary maximum: held, the value is forced; released, the
# encoder's stored position comes back untouched, with no jump. Every push
# below is that gesture, and the slots that are blank are blank on purpose.
#
# ALL TEN ARE BUILT. The last column is the build each one first shipped in,
# which is more use than a bare "yes" and cannot rot the way a NOT BUILT marker
# does -- four of them were still claiming NOT BUILT three builds after they
# went on the module.

# TEN, and it is final (D-26). Three slots went, for three different reasons.
#
#   `Off` went at b6. CC 57 is a working master bypass and did the job better,
#   so a slot spent on it was a dead encoder position.
#
#   Two mid/side modes went at b10, and they are IMPOSSIBLE rather than merely
#   unwritten (D-27). Both need a mid/side matrix, which is per-sample
#   arithmetic on the raw buffers, and D-19 forbids that absolutely. There is
#   no way round it in band parameters either: the EQ object loads ONE
#   coefficient set per band and applies it to BOTH channels -- only the
#   recursive state is per-channel -- so band parameters cannot express a
#   left-right difference at any setting. Do not re-open this, and do not
#   propose a per-sample loop for it.
#
#   The tone-shaping mode recorded as the fallback for the slot those two
#   vacated went with them (D-28). Tilt already covers tone shaping, and ten
#   modes that each earn their place beat eleven with a passenger.
#
#   Neither the two nor the fallback is named here, on purpose. A name in a
#   comment is a name a future session will try to build, and this table is the
#   first place it would look. EQ-CONTROL-LAYOUT.md carries the record of what
#   was dropped and why; that is the one place any of them should appear.
#
# Nothing renumbered when twelve became ten: the two that went sat past every
# other slot, so every built mode kept its value and `gapply`'s five compares
# were untouched. EQ-CONTROL-LAYOUT.md is the authority here (D-31) and it
# supersedes D-08 and MASTER-EQ-DESIGN.md section 5.

# does not sound like speech, which at the bench is indistinguishable from a DSP
# bug. So the provenance is written down at the same length as the numbers.

#
# Peterson, G. E. and Barney, H. L. (1952), "Control Methods Used in a Study of
# the Vowels", Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 24(2), 175-184.
#
# The rows below were NOT copied from a secondary table. They were COMPUTED, on
# 2026-09-05, from that study's own measurements: `verified_pb.data` in the CMU
# Artificial Intelligence Repository's `areas/speech/database/pb/` package,
#
#   www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/ai-repository/ai/areas/speech/database/pb/pb.tgz
#
# which is 1,520 rows -- 76 speakers x 10 vowels x 2 repetitions -- of speaker
# class, speaker id, vowel, F0, F1, F2 and F3 in Hz. It reached CMU from the
# University of Pennsylvania and is the file documented in Watrous, JASA 89
# (May 1991). Each row below is the MEAN OVER THE 33 MEN, sixty-six utterances
# per vowel, rounded to the nearest 10 Hz.
#
# The method is recorded rather than only the citation, so anybody who doubts a
# number can regenerate the whole table in four lines instead of arguing about
# it: filter the file to class 1, group by the ARPABET column, average columns
# 6, 7 and 8.
#
# --- HOW THE VOWELS ARE NAMED HERE ------------------------------------------
#
# THIS FILE IS PURE ASCII and IPA is not, so every vowel below is named three
# ways that are all unambiguous: the dataset's own ARPABET code, the keyword
# Peterson and Barney recorded it in, and the letter this mode's knob shows.
# ARPABET is the one to trust in an argument -- it is what the data file
# itself says, and it needs no transcription convention.
#
#   knob  ARPABET  keyword
#   I     IY       heed
#   E     EH       head
#   A     AA       hod
#   O     AO       hawed
#   U     UW       who'd
#
# --- WHAT WAS CHECKED AGAINST WHAT ------------------------------------------
#
# The computed means agree with the average-male table that is quoted
# second-hand throughout the literature, within one 10 Hz rounding step on every
# value except one:
#
#   vowel        computed here        commonly quoted      difference
#   IY  heed     270  2290  2940      270  2290  3010      F3, 70 Hz (2.4%)
#   EH  head     530  1850  2480      530  1840  2480      F2, 10 Hz
#   AA  hod      720  1090  2440      730  1090  2440      F1, 10 Hz
#   AO  hawed    570   840  2400      570   840  2410      F3, 10 Hz
#   UW  who'd    310   880  2240      300   870  2240      F1, 10 Hz
#
# The one real gap is /i/'s third formant, and it is the least load-bearing
# number in the table: F3 of the brightest vowel, a 6 dB bell 2.4% off a
# frequency the shift control moves by an octave either way. The computed value
# ships, because it is the one derived from the primary data.
#
# --- THE LABEL DISCREPANCY, AND HOW IT WAS RESOLVED -------------------------
#
# The phase research found a course PDF whose second vowel box was captioned as
# the O vowel but carried 530/1840/2480, and separately proposed 570/840/2410
# for O from memory. Those two claims cannot both be right, and the second was
# flagged as unsourced. A row in that state must not reach firmware.
#
# BOTH ARE NOW SETTLED, AND THE HYPOTHESIS THE PLAN OFFERED IS CONFIRMED. In
# Peterson and Barney's own ten-vowel set, "head" and "hawed" are DIFFERENT
# vowels with different rows -- the dataset's own HEADER lists them separately,
# as `3 EH` and `7 AO`. Computed from the primary data, EH is 530/1850/2480 and
# AO is 570/840/2400. So the course PDF's caption was wrong and its numbers were
# right: they are the EH row. And the row proposed from memory for O turns out
# to be the real AO row, almost to the hertz. Nothing here now rests on that
# memory -- the shipped value was recomputed from the measurements -- but it is
# worth recording that the two sources agreed once they were correctly labelled.
#
# There is a documented mechanism for exactly this confusion, and it is worth
# recording because the next reader will find the same PDF. Praat's manual page
# for "Create formant table (Peterson & Barney 1952)" notes that the IPA
# notation in Watrous (1991) -- the transcription nearly every redistribution of
# this dataset descends from, including the CMU copy used here -- differs from
# Peterson and Barney's own for three vowels, EH, AO and ER. Where the original
# writes an open-mid symbol, Watrous writes a close-mid one. A table that
# inherits one convention and a caption that inherits the other is how an EH row
# ends up wearing an O label.
#
# THIS COPY SIDESTEPS THE WHOLE QUESTION by naming vowels in ARPABET and taking
# the numbers from the measurements rather than from any caption, so neither
# convention can bite it.
#
# --- THE ORDER IS D-29, AND THE DATA AGREES WITH IT -------------------------
#
# I -> E -> A -> O -> U, front to back, which is the vowel chart traversed once
# rather than crossfaded across. That matters here more than anywhere: EVERY
# knob position between two rows is an interpolation, so adjacency decides what
# the in-between positions sound like. Adjacent vowels interpolate into a real
# intermediate vowel; unrelated ones interpolate into a chord of two.
#
# The measurements bear the ordering out. F2 -- the front-back formant -- falls
# right down the column: 2290, 1850, 1090, 840, 880. The one step that does not
# fall is U, forty hertz above O, and that is the data being honest rather than
# a fault: /u/ is distinguished from /O/ mostly by a much lower F1 (310 against
# 570) and by lip rounding, not by F2. The last step of the morph is carried by
# F1, and it should still read as a move further back.
#
# This supersedes the A -> E -> I -> O -> U ordering that survives in older
# proposal tables. Correct it wherever it is still found.
EQ_FMT_TABLE = (
    (270.0, 2290.0, 2940.0),   # I  IY  "heed"
    (530.0, 1850.0, 2480.0),   # E  EH  "head"

)

# Q and gain per formant, F1 first. UNLIKE THE FREQUENCIES, THESE SIX ARE NOT
# MEASUREMENTS -- they are starting points under Claude's Discretion, gated by
# the D-17 sweep for safety and by ears for whether it sounds like a voice.
# Nothing offline in this project can judge either.
#
# The shape of both ladders is the argument, not the exact values:
#
#   F1 is the loudest and the broadest. It sits closest to where the rest of the
#   spectral energy already is, so it reads as the BODY of the vowel; a narrow
#   F1 reads as a whistle sitting on top of the music instead of as a voice
#   inside it.
#
#   F2 and F3 are narrower and quieter, in a declining ladder, which is what
#   natural vocal-tract spectral tilt does. Boosting them equally makes
#   something bright and sibilant rather than something spoken.
#
# The Qs are DELIBERATELY far lower than a real vocal tract's. A measured
# formant has a bandwidth around 40-110 Hz, which is a Q of 10 to 20; the Csound
# manual's formant table (Table III, Piche and Nix) gives exactly that range.
# Those are the numbers for SYNTHESISING a voice out of silence. This is an EQ
# boosting a signal that is already there, and a Q of 15 on a mix is nearly
# inaudible -- the boost falls between the partials. 4 / 7 / 9 is the audible
# end of the same shape.
#
# If it does not read as a vowel on hardware, RAISE THE QS FIRST -- that is the
# axis this compromise is on, and it is one edit and one sweep.

# a true 1.0 in the centre detent. An octave is the right span because it is the

# THE RANGE ASSERT, AND WHY IT IS HERE RATHER THAN IN A TEST. This is the only

# by construction; these fifteen values, multiplied by the shift, go straight to
# 1010music's designer. EQ_F_LO is where a two-pole section's stability margin
# starts collapsing and EQ_F_HI is the designer's own SR/4 ceiling, so an
# out-of-window frequency is not a cosmetic problem.
#
# It runs at import, so it fires on EVERY build rather than when somebody
# remembers to check. Same reason as the four EQ_S_* asserts above.

  Community enhancements for Bitbox Micro -- 2.3.10-mod
  -----------------------------------------------------

  Adds to the stock 2.3.4 firmware:
    - MIDI control of the master compressor (with auto makeup) and EQ
    - per-pad controls the module keeps off MIDI: granular, sends, reverse,
      sustain, loop, LFO, play through, stop; and the delay's switches
    - Character: four effects in a chain on the master bus
    - a pop-up naming what a control just changed, and a CPU bar
    - Settings: Preset BPM, Clk Loss, Flip UI, OSD, Keep CCs, ProgChange,
      Theme
    - Clip modes: loops that follow the tempo, Live Flip modes, hold buttons
    - three Airwindows compressors beside the stock one

  You need your own copy of the stock 2.3.4 firmware, from 1010music's
  downloads page -- none of it is included here. It arrives as MICRO234.zip;
  unzip it and you get MICRO.BIN.

    mkdir patched
    {PY} patch_micro.py MICRO.BIN patched/MICRO.BIN

  The output must be called MICRO.BIN for the module to find it, which is why
  it goes in its own folder -- writing over your only stock copy would leave
  you no way back.

  A third argument sets the version string on the splash screen. Keep it to
  {VER_DISPLAY_MAX} characters or fewer -- the slot stores 15 but the panel shows
  fewer than that, and a truncated version means you cannot tell which image
  is on the card.

# --- C hooks: compiled by clang, linked HERE, frozen ---------------------------
# Every hook above is hand-written assembly. The Character chain (hook N) is
# DSP, which is written in C. There is no ELF linker on a stock Mac, so this
# file does the link itself: clang produces one relocatable object, the object
# is reduced to its allocated sections, its relocations and its exported
# symbols, and `c_link` places it at whatever origin the image has reached.
#
# The REDUCED OBJECT is what gets frozen (FROZEN_C), not linked bytes, because
# the origin moves with the opt-in hooks in front of it. Linking a frozen
# object needs no toolchain and is deterministic, so a no-toolchain build still
# reproduces the image byte for byte. --reassemble recompiles the C and refuses
# if the frozen object has drifted from the source.
#
# Rules the C must keep, enforced here rather than remembered:
#   - no writable data at all (.data/.bss): state lives at fixed patch-RAM
#     addresses, reached through pointers, never in a linked section;
#   - no libc: every external symbol must be passed in `externs` explicitly;
#   - only the relocation types below. Anything else refuses loudly, because a
#     relocation applied wrongly is a wild branch, not a build error.

    auto_table (--comp-types, 2.3.10-b3/b4; frozen as hookDa): CC 46's makeup
    from CMP_STOCK_AUTO_DB, and CC 46 OFF as the first touch since boot now
    writes the store's checksum. b4: CC 46 is three bands (0-42 Off, 43-85
    Normal, 86-127 Hot; the auto record holds AUTO_MAGIC or AUTO_HOT) and Hot
    reads CMP_STOCK_AUTO_HOT_DB. In 2.3.9-mod (hookDr) that path seeded the
    store and left without a checksum, so hook E refused it: a compressor
    switched on afterwards ran 1010music's own settings (4 dB quieter, CC
    41-45 apparently ignored) until one of CC 41-45 was sent.

    full_range (rc1, --v239 only; frozen as hookDr): CC 41-45 reach the top of
    their range. The dispatcher delivers every CC as byte << 7 (0x080439de:
    `ldrb r0, [r4, #2]; lsls r0, #7` -- it never pairs CC n with n+32), so
    127 arrived as 16256 and the top was 99.2% of the way: threshold -0.3 dB,
    ratio 19.85:1, makeup +35.4 dB. A value whose low seven bits are all zero
    is widened to (v << 7) | v, so 127 -> 16383. A value with any low bit set
    would be true 14-bit and passes unchanged -- no path in 2.3.4 produces
    one, but the rule cannot break one. CC 40 (a switch) is unchanged.

    CC 40 writes the session's on/off flag directly -- the session is allocated
    once at boot, so that target is stable, and hardware testing confirms it.
    It is found by proof rather than arithmetic: scan the engine's pointer slots
    and validate each candidate by reading back the safety limiter's two timing
    constants, which nothing on the module ever writes.

    CC 41-45 do not touch the engine at all. They write the patch's own store,
    which hook E applies to the live object every block.

    /* r0 AND r1 ARE THE STOCK CALL'S ARGUMENTS. DO NOT CLOBBER THEM.
       This hook is reached by a chain that BRANCHES rather than calls, so it
       shares the register state of the original `bl FUN_080950c0` at
       MIDI_POST_CALL, 0x08093f14. The two instructions immediately before that
       call -- `ldr r0,[r7]` and `mov r1,r6` -- are setting up arguments, and
       0x080950c0 is not a function at all, it is a this-adjusting thunk: it
       adds 0x127dc to the incoming r0 and tail-branches to the queue-append at
       0x080a396c. r2, r3 and r12 are scratch here; r0 and r1 must arrive
       intact.

       Hook D used to fall out of `dout` with r0 holding a patch-store address
       around 0x2406c000, on BOTH its CC 40 path and its CC 41-45 path.
       0x2406c000 + 0x127dc = 0x2407e7dc, which IS mapped -- AXI SRAM -- so it
       corrupted quietly instead of faulting: up to 64 records of 24 bytes once
       per boot, with the queue's own `cmp r7, #0x3f` bound stopping it there.
       Hook F's equivalent formed 0x101227aa, which is NOT mapped, and hard
       faulted on every EQ CC until it was bracketed. The same defect and
       different luck, and the luck is the whole reason this one shipped in two
       firmware versions while hook F's was found in an afternoon. Fixed under
       D-32 in 2.3.7-b16.

       The pop sits at `dout`, BEFORE `dnext`. Hook C is downstream of that
       tail branch and reads the caller frame at sp+0x90 and sp+0x94 counting
       only its own `push {{r4, r5, lr}}`, so a pop placed after the branch
       would leave SP eight bytes low and break the delay FX CCs -- a different
       fault, and not one a compressor test would catch. Every caller-frame
       read below is therefore written `+ 8`, and THERE ARE FOUR OF THEM, NOT
       THREE: MSG_VAL_SP is read twice, once at `dfound` for the CC 40
       threshold compare and once at `dseeded` for the CC 41-45 conversion. */

    Both hooks can be first to run -- hook G on the first audio block, hook F on
    the first CC -- so both must be able to seed, and they must agree exactly or
    the checksum will reject whichever went second. `gen` starts at 1 and `agen`
    at 0, so hook G applies the mode on its very first block.

    `scratch` IS DESTROYED, and naming it is not a style preference. This block
    is eleven stores long and every one of them needs a register to store FROM;
    it used to take that register (`r3`) silently. Hook G can afford that -- it
    reloads everything from `r6` afterwards -- but hook F is holding the CC
    index in `r3` at exactly this point, and the block left it holding the
    checksum constant `0x1010ffce` instead. Every compare at `fseeded` then
    missed and `fplain` did `ldrb r0, [r0, r3]`, reading `fslots + 0x1010ffce`
    -- about `0x181f44d6`, reserved space on this part. Bus fault, hard fault,
    watchdog. That was the reboot on the first EQ CC after boot, and only the
    first, because the seed runs once and the module never got far enough to
    have a second.

    So the caller passes a register it can prove is dead here, and the assert
    below refuses the one mistake that is easy to make twice.

    All three controls are seeded at EQ_CENTRE, and that is D-16's whole
    mechanism. The old seed laid the character control down at 0, so Notch
    booted at its widest Q and Band Pass at its narrowest width -- both of the
    things D-16 says must not happen, measured by the simulator's --boot-state
    before this changed. Centring costs no new constant. Every button and the

       This hook replaces `bl FUN_080950c0` at MIDI_POST_CALL, and the two
       instructions immediately before that call are `ldr r0,[r7]` and
       `mov r1,r6` -- they are setting up arguments. FUN_080950c0 is not a
       function, it is a this-adjusting thunk:
           mov r3,r0 / ldr r0,=0x000127d8 / mov.w r2,#0x400 / add r0,r3
           b.w 0x080a83a4   ->  r2==0x400 -> add r0,#4 -> b.w 0x080a396c
       so the object pointer it finally dereferences is `incoming r0 + 0x127dc`.
       r2 and r3 are dead on entry (the thunk overwrites both), r12 is scratch
       by AAPCS -- but r0 and r1 must arrive intact.

       Hook F used to fall out of `fbump` with r0 holding the freshly computed
       EQ CHECKSUM, about 0x1010ffce. 0x1010ffce + 0x127dc = 0x101227aa, which
       is not mapped on this part: bus fault, hard fault, watchdog reboot. That
       is the reboot on every EQ CC, and it is why moving the store (dbgZ) did
       not help -- the fatal value is the checksum itself, not where it lives.

       BOTH HOOKS AT THIS SITE NOW BRACKET. Hook D committed the identical
       violation and shipped with it from 2.3.6: its leftover r0 was a store
       address around 0x2406c000, so 0x2406c000 + 0x127dc = 0x2407e7dc landed
       in mapped AXI SRAM and merely corrupted rather than faulting. Same
       defect, different luck -- and the luck is why hook F's was found in an
       afternoon and hook D's took two firmware versions. Fixed under D-32 in
       2.3.7-b16, with this same bracket. ANY future hook chained at
       MIDI_POST_CALL must do the same. See DEV-README's chain-ABI note before
       adding one. */

           bypass), Dual Cut's A and B (force a cut fully open), Band Pass's B
           (force the width widest), Notch's depth slam, and the flat/neutral
           and maximum-effect buttons the four unbuilt modes are specified to
           get.

        2. The KILL kind, which does NOT use `ctl` at all. It still calls
           `gsetband` for that band and it still sets that band's mask bit --
           what changes is the band's TYPE, swapped to a kill shape out of
           `gmixk` / `gmixkq` / `gmixkg`. Kill low becomes a high-pass at
           150 Hz, kill high a low-pass at 4 kHz, and kill mid a wide -24 dB
           scoop at 700 Hz. Mixer EQ's three kill buttons are this kind, and
           Tone + Filter's two will be when it is built.

           DO NOT "kill" a band by disabling it. b6 did exactly that, reasoning
           that a disabled band passes nothing. That is true of the BAND and
           false of the AUDIO: a disabled band applies no filter, so the signal
           passes straight through untouched. Worse, Rule 1 already puts every
           band at 0 dB at centre, which is where the knobs rest, so the kill
           was removing something that was already transparent and did nothing
           audible at all. The user found it in the first minute of play.
           Attenuating instead would not have worked either -- `ggain`'s floor
           is -24 dB and a shelf at -24 dB still passes everything past its
           corner.

           D-25 is what makes the type swap the only available lever, and it is
           worth stating plainly: NO BAND IS EVER SWITCHED OFF. A band a mode
           does not want is designed as a flat Param, H(z) = 1 exactly. Only
           the target ever changes, so 1010music's 50 ms smoother ramps every
           transition in both directions, which is what removed the b7
           reconfiguration ring and the b8 click. So the only lever any button
           has is WHAT gets designed, never WHETHER.

        DJ Filter's button B is a third shape only in appearance -- it *adds*
        the cascaded second section rather than swapping a type -- and it is
        the one already in the file, at the bottom of `gmdj`.

    /* r8 is pushed only to keep SP 8-byte aligned across the `blx` into
       1010music's designer: five core registers plus lr is 24 bytes, which is
       what AAPCS wants, where the natural {{r4,r5,r6,r7,lr}} would leave SP at
       4. `vpush {{d8,d9,d10}}` is NOT optional -- the mode routines park
       frequency, Q and gain in s16..s21 across `bl gsetband`, and s16-s31 are
       callee-saved, so this hook owes its own caller the same.

       THREE PAIRS, NOT TWO, from Multi Notch on. That mode designs four bands
       from shared controls, so a base index, a spread, a depth and a Q all have
       to survive three further `bl gsetband` calls on top of the frequency the
       loop recomputes each turn -- six floats live, and four saved registers do
       not hold six. Widening the save set is always safe: s16-s31 are
       callee-saved by AAPCS, so saving more of them can only ever be more
       correct, and three register pairs is 24 bytes, which keeps SP 8-byte
       aligned exactly as two pairs did.

       THE `vpush` AND THE `vpop` MUST CHANGE TOGETHER. A mismatched pair does
       not fail here; it corrupts the caller's FP register file on the way out,
       which is the same class of fault as the `s2` clobber b10 shipped and is
       far harder to see. */

    /* MASTER BYPASS IS NOT TESTED HERE. It used to be, and that is why it never
       bypassed anything: `gout` contains no store, so the four bands kept
       whatever the last `gapply` left them and the stock handler carried on
       filtering. The 50 ms smoother could not help, because a smoother ramps
       toward a TARGET and the target never changed. Bypass FROZE the EQ. The
       test now lives inside `gapply`, after `gclr` and before the mode
       dispatch, and takes the identity fill. See the note there.

       APPLY EVERY BLOCK, UNCONDITIONALLY -- the same shape as hook E, which
       stamps the compressor's store onto its live object every block and is
       the most robust thing in this patch.

       What used to be here was `cmp gen, agen / beq gout`: rebuild only when
       the generation moved. It looked like a free economy and it was not. The
       counter tracks OUR INTENT, not the OBJECT'S STATE. A preset load
       reconstructs the EQ object to constructor defaults and does not touch
       our patch RAM, so the store still said `agen == gen` and hook G took the
       early exit forever. The object stayed configured by nobody: audio
       passing, nothing happening, and a null test cannot see it, because every
       failure exits to pass-through and pass-through is what the test expects.

       `agen` is still written, so the store's shape and its checksum
       arithmetic do not change and nothing downstream has to learn a new
       layout. It simply stops being a gate.

       The cost was BOUNDED from the disassembly before this was changed, not
       asserted afterwards: 2,512 instructions / 5,444 cycles against a
       1,280,000-cycle block, 0.43%. D-25 is what makes that a real bound --
       the identity fill means `gapply` designs exactly four bands on every
       call in every mode, so the worst case is the typical case. Counts and
       method are in DEV-README. */

                                          `ggain`'s two-segment shape, for
                                          `ggain`'s reasons, with one difference
                                          that matters: the detent branch
                                          returns a LITERAL 1.0 rather than
                                          something that computes to nearly one.
                                          A shift of 0.999 would move every
                                          formant off the table by a hair with
                                          the knob centred, which is small
                                          enough to be inaudible and exactly the
                                          kind of thing that is later blamed on
                                          the table.

                                          TWO CONSTANTS, ONE `vfma`. The
                                          multiplier is 1.0 + span * u on both
                                          sides, with span -0.5 below centre and
                                          +1.0 above, so the stops land on 0.5
                                          and 2.0 -- one octave each way. That
                                          is `ggcut` / `ggboo`'s structure, so
                                          the two laws read against each other.

                                          NO CLAMP, for `ggain`'s exact reason:
                                          EQ_HALF_SPAN is precisely the travel
                                          available either side of the detent,
                                          so the widest input lands on exactly
                                          1.0 and the law reaches its stops
                                          without ever passing them.

                                          RULE 2: clockwise raises the formants,
                                          which is the direction a listener
                                          expects a voice to move. */

       `gclr` has just run, so all four bands are type 0 with enable 0 and the
       mask is 0. `gmout` therefore designs all four as an explicit identity
       Param at 0 dB, which 1010music's designer resolves to H(z) = 1 exactly:
       a bit-exact wire, max |b - a| = 0.000e+00 against the dry signal. It is
       the same path every unbuilt slot took on b10, which swept all ten
       detents with no pops and no clicks, so it is already hardware-proven
       silent.

       And because it is a TARGET change rather than a hard cut, the stock
       smoother at obj+0x168 ramps it in over 50 ms and back out again. No
       click going in, no ring coming out.

       THE TRAP, NAMED SO NOBODY TAKES IT LATER: do not "simplify" this to
       writing enable = 0 to all four bands. The stock handler then skips them
       and audio genuinely passes through, so it looks correct -- and that is
       exactly what makes it dangerous. A band that stops being enabled stops
       contributing INSTANTLY, which is b8's click, and resumes with stale
       coefficients and stale filter history, which is b7's ring. Both were
       rejected on hardware. For a KILL that shape was wrong because it passed
       audio; for a BYPASS passing audio is the whole point, which is precisely
       why the fault would ship unnoticed. The identity fill has neither. */

                                          nothing is more honest than one
                                          duplicating its neighbour. So this
                                          routine reads neither EQ_S_GC nor

                                          designed, mask left at 0 by gclr.
                                          That chain is deliberate. If the
                                          detent ever changes width, come back

       unassigned because drive was the only candidate and D-05 banned it;
       slope is pure biquad work, so the objection does not reach it.

       BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT THIS CONTROL DOES. Once two sections exist the
       ASYMPTOTIC slope is 24 dB/oct and stays there -- cascaded biquads
       quantise at 12 dB a stage and no amount of sweeping changes that. What
       varies continuously is the KNEE: how far up the band the second section
       sits, so how early the transition starts and how abruptly it bites.
       Converged on the first section is the hard 24 dB corner; spread away
       from it the response leans on one section near the corner and reads as
       roughly 12 dB there, tightening to 24 further out. That is a real and
       useful sweep and it is not a continuous slope, so do not label it one.

       Fully anticlockwise there is no second section at all, which IS a true
       12 dB/oct -- the b5 behaviour, still reachable, deliberately kept.

       CC 59 rides on top through the ordinary `ctl` forced-value path: held,
       control C reads as maximum and the knee snaps hard 24. Released, the
       encoder's own position returns untouched with no jump. That needs no
       special case in hook F -- see the note in the return for why routing

                                          transparent and did nothing audible at
                                          all. The user found exactly that --
                                          the kills only worked once an encoder
                                          had been turned away from centre.

                                          A kill must REMOVE that part of the
                                          spectrum, dramatically, FROM CENTRE,
                                          which is where the knobs rest. So a
                                          held kill swaps the band's TYPE rather
                                          than nudging its gain: low becomes a
                                          high-pass at 150 Hz, high becomes a
                                          low-pass at 4 kHz, mid becomes a wide
                                          -24 dB scoop at 700 Hz. Attenuating
                                          instead would not do it -- ggain's
                                          floor is -24 dB and a shelf at -24 dB
                                          still passes everything past its
                                          corner.

                                          The band is always designed either
                                          way, so the mask is always 7 and the
                                          stored encoder value is never written.
                                          Release returns the sound to exactly
                                          where the knob is: D-03, unchanged. */

                                          shelf, C is a bipolar filter with a
                                          centre detent.

                                          D-14 reshaped `Full desk` into this,
                                          and it is the only built mode the
                                          three-encoder budget genuinely broke.
                                          Losing the mid band buys tone AND a
                                          filter on one panel with no mode
                                          change, which is worth more live than
                                          three gains and an unreachable filter.

                                          RULE 3: control A is HIGH. That is the
                                          same correction b6 made to Mixer EQ
                                          after the user found it reading upside
                                          down inside the first minute of play,
                                          and it is not negotiable by preference.

                                          THE TWO PUSHES ARE KILLS, and they are
                                          literally two of Mixer EQ's three --
                                          the same gmixk / gmixkq / gmixkg
                                          shapes at the same corners, which is
                                          why this routine sits directly under
                                          `gmix3` rather than in dial order.

                                          A KILL SWAPS THE BAND'S TYPE and still
                                          calls `gsetband`; it never disables a
                                          band and never omits a mask bit. That
                                          is D-25, and it is what makes the
                                          gesture dramatic FROM CENTRE, which is
                                          where the knobs rest under Rule 1. b6
                                          killed by leaving the band DISABLED:
                                          a disabled band applies no filter, so
                                          the audio passed straight through and
                                          the kill removed something that was
                                          already transparent. Attenuating is no
                                          better -- `ggain`'s floor is -24 dB
                                          and a shelf at -24 dB still passes
                                          everything past its corner.

                                          RULE 1: both shelves take `ggain`,
                                          exactly 0.0 dB in the detent, and the
                                          filter is not engaged at all inside
                                          its own. Centred knobs give two flat
                                          shelves and two undesigned bands --
                                          the EQ doing nothing. */

       different things: `gmdj`'s dead band is a whole-mode bypass that leaves

       3. D-30 also puts `gmdj` out of bounds for reworking here -- the five
       modes that are already playing are not touched by this plan.

       C's push forces the RAW CENTRE, which is Rule 4's OPEN gesture: held, the
       filter stops acting and lets everything through; released, the encoder's
       stored position comes back untouched, so nothing jumps.

       THE FILTER IS DELIBERATELY NON-RESONANT. There is no fourth encoder for
       resonance in this mode and tone wins the two it has. DJ Filter is where
       resonance lives, and putting it here would cost a shelf. Not forgotten --

                                          landed on 692.8 Hz at centre and
                                          cancelled to silence.
                                          The law is `ghalf`: the anticlockwise
                                          half is a plateau at fully open, and
                                          the clockwise half closes the cut.

       everything outside the band, then lift what is left. Distinct from the
       unbuilt Peak mode, which boosts WITHOUT cutting its surroundings.

       THE BAND BUDGET IS FOUR AND THIS MODE NOW WANTS FIVE. Two cuts, one
       gain bell, and a symmetric 24 dB/oct cascade needs two more. So the two
       compete, and gain wins when it is asked for:

         gain flat (C in the detent)  -> bands 2 and 3 are free, and CC 59
                                         cascades both edges exactly as in b6

                                         ignored in this mode

       Gain flat is the resting state, so CC 59 keeps working everywhere the
       performer has not deliberately asked for a boost. The alternative --
       dropping the cascade outright -- would have cost a capability that
       already works on hardware, for a case that only arises once you turn
       control C. Rule 1 is safe either way: the detent is flat, so at centre
       no bell is designed at all. */

       s0-s15 are caller-saved: a callee may destroy any of them and owes the
       caller nothing. s16-s31 are callee-saved, which is why hook G's prologue
       `vpush {{d8, d9, d10}}` and why every other mode routine parks its
       frequency, its Q and its gain in s16..s21 across a call. This routine improvised,
       and that is the defect -- not the maths, not the mode, not the remap.

       What b7 (`61efbede`) shipped, and b10 was simply the first image to put
       on hardware: the gain was computed FIRST and parked in s2, then `gftab`
       was called. `gftab` ends `vldr s2, [r1]`, so s2 came back holding the
       CENTRE FREQUENCY IN HERTZ. `gsetband`'s ABI is s2 = gain in dB, so the
       bell was designed at 40 to 12000 dB where at most +9 was asked for. The
       `vmov.f32 s2, s2` that used to sit two instructions above `bl gsetband`
       was a NO-OP that read as intent, which is how it survived review.

       The fix is a reorder, not a relocation: compute the frequency first and
       keep it in s16, then compute the gain LAST, so nothing whatsoever runs
       between `bl ggain` and `bl gsetband` and there is no lifetime to get
       wrong. This is now the same shape as every other mode routine. The five
       modes still to be built use this same compute-a-gain-then-call-gsetband
       pattern; copy THIS one. */

                                          gain, IS a tilt. Clockwise lifts the

                                          number of decibels, so the see-saw

                                          That is why this calls `gtiltd` and
                                          not `ggain`.

                                          RULE 1: `gtiltd` returns exactly 0.0
                                          inside the detent, so both shelves are
                                          designed and both are flat. The hinge
                                          needs NO centre handling at all -- a
                                          shelf at 0 dB is transparent whatever
                                          its corner is, so only the control
                                          that maps to gain is Rule 1's problem.

                                          Bands 2 and 3 are not touched, and
                                          `gmout` gives them the identity fill

                                          RULE 1: `ggain` is exactly 0.0 dB in
                                          the centre detent, so the band is
                                          designed and transparent. Frequency
                                          and Q are free at centre for the same
                                          reason Tilt's hinge is.

                                          Button A is unread -- CC 54 is inert
                                          here, deliberately. B forces maximum Q
                                          and C maximum boost: both are Rule 4
                                          hold-to-slam, both forced in the RAW
                                          CC domain so they take the same curve
                                          the encoder would, and neither writes
                                          the stored value, so release hands
                                          back with no jump. */

                                          B is the depth, C is the spread.

                                          THE SHAPE IS A PHASER'S; THE
                                          MECHANISM IS FOUR `gsetband` CALLS.
                                          D-15 renamed the slot away from
                                          `Phaser` on a DSP argument that still
                                          holds: a real phaser is a cascade of
                                          all-pass sections with feedback, which
                                          is new per-sample DSP and D-19 bans it
                                          outright. NONE OF THAT IS REOPENED
                                          HERE. There is still no all-pass, no
                                          feedback and no per-sample code --
                                          four Param bands, four calls, no
                                          filter state of our own.

                                          What changed at b14 is the LABEL, and
                                          the performer's argument for it is
                                          about sound rather than topology: a
                                          small number of
                                          non-harmonically-related notches
                                          sweeping together as one body IS the
                                          audible signature of a phaser, and
                                          that is what came off the module. It
                                          is emphatically NOT a comb -- a comb's
                                          notches are harmonically locked and
                                          sound metallic and tuned, and these
                                          are neither. It also sounds nothing
                                          like the single Notch at dial 7, which
                                          is what earns it a slot.

                                          THE SPACING IS A RATIO, NOT AN
                                          INTERVAL COUNT. `gftab`'s table is
                                          logarithmic, so a fixed number of
                                          table steps is a fixed RATIO between
                                          neighbours, and geometric spacing can
                                          never be a comb's arithmetic harmonic
                                          series. What is NOT automatic is
                                          landing away from a musical ratio;
                                          EQ_MN_SP_LO / EQ_MN_SP_HI carry that
                                          arithmetic and the reason for it, and
                                          no offline gate has an opinion on it.

                                          RULE 1 RESTS ENTIRELY ON THE DEPTH.
                                          A Param band at 0 dB is H(z) = 1
                                          whatever its frequency and its Q are,
                                          so `ghalf` returning exactly 0.0 at
                                          and below centre makes all four bands
                                          transparent wherever sweep and spread
                                          happen to sit. Those two carry no
                                          Rule 1 obligation at all.

                                          ALL FOUR BANDS ARE DESIGNED ON EVERY
                                          REBUILD and the mask is always 15, so
                                          `gmout` finds nothing to fill. That is
                                          D-25 satisfied rather than dodged: no
                                          band is ever switched off, and a notch
                                          is made inaudible by its depth
                                          reaching 0 dB, never by being skipped.

                                          BUTTON A IS UNREAD -- CC 54 is inert
                                          here, deliberately, and that absence is
                                          a decision the simulator's
                                          unread-control check turns into an
                                          executable claim. */

                                          EQ_FMT_TABLE for the citation, for how
                                          the rows were computed, and for the
                                          label discrepancy that had to be
                                          settled before a single instruction of
                                          this routine was written. They are the
                                          only constants in this patch that came
                                          from outside it.

                                          THE ORDER IS D-29 AND IT IS THE WHOLE
                                          DESIGN. Front to back, so every step
                                          is between ADJACENT vowels and every
                                          intermediate knob position interpolates
                                          into a real vowel rather than into a
                                          chord of two unrelated ones. A
                                          different ordering would still sweep;
                                          it would just stop sounding like
                                          speech in between.

                                          THE INTERPOLATION IS CONTROL RATE AND
                                          MUST STAY THAT WAY. It runs here,
                                          inside `gapply`, once per accepted

                                          spread, Band Pass's half-width and
                                          Dual Cut's bipolar corner already do
                                          their sums. D-19 forbids the arm
                                          computing anything per sample or
                                          reading a sample buffer, and nothing
                                          here does either: the result of every

                                          and its 50 ms smoother do the rest. If
                                          a future session wants the morph
                                          "smoother" and reaches for a frame
                                          loop, THE SMOOTHER IS ALREADY THERE,
                                          on the other side of `gsetband`, and
                                          a frame loop is what caused every
                                          failure of 2026-09-04.

                                          RULE 1 RESTS ENTIRELY ON THE
                                          INTENSITY, exactly as Phaser's rests
                                          on its depth. A Param at 0 dB is
                                          H(z) = 1 whatever its frequency and Q
                                          are, so `ghalf` returning exactly 0.0
                                          at and below centre makes all three
                                          bells transparent wherever the vowel
                                          and the shift happen to sit. Those two
                                          carry no Rule 1 obligation at all,
                                          which is what lets the vowel rest on a
                                          real vowel instead of on a boundary.

                                          BAND 3 IS NOT SKIPPED. The mask is 3
                                          bands' worth, 7, and band 3 falls
                                          through to `gmout`'s identity fill.
                                          That is D-25: no band is ever switched
                                          off, a band a mode does not want is a
                                          flat Param, and the stock smoother
                                          ramps every transition in and out.

                                          BUTTONS A AND C ARE UNREAD. CC 54 and
                                          CC 56 are inert in this mode,
                                          deliberately: the vowel has no
                                          "correct" position to slam to and the
                                          shift's neutral is already the detent,
                                          which `Reset Mid` reaches without
                                          spending a CC (Rule 4). That absence
                                          is a decision, and the simulator's
                                          unread-control check turns it into an
                                          executable claim rather than this

                                          `gmphone`'s lesson still applies to

    /* EVERY BAND THE MODE DID NOT BUILD IS DESIGNED AS AN EXPLICIT IDENTITY,
       not switched off. This is what makes a mode change silent, and it is
       worth understanding before anyone "simplifies" it back.

       A band that stops being enabled stops contributing INSTANTLY: the output
       jumps from whatever that band was doing to dry, and a jump is a click.
       A band that starts being enabled is worse -- it resumes with whatever
       coefficients and filter history it had when it last ran, which is the
       ring b7 shipped.

       Neither is fixable by clearing state. Clearing state removes the ring and
       keeps the click, which is what b8 did and what the user rejected.

       So no band is ever switched off. Unused bands are designed as a Param at
       0 dB, which 1010music's own designer resolves to b0 = 1, b1 = a1,
       b2 = a2 -- H(z) = 1 exactly, a bit-exact wire once its state settles, and
       self-correcting because z1 accumulates a1*(x - y) which is zero when
       y = x. The band keeps running, so its history stays continuous and there
       is nothing stale to resume from.

       Then the ONLY thing that ever changes is the target coefficient set, and
       the stock smoother already ramps current toward target with a 50 ms time
       constant -- (blockSize/sampleRate)/0.05 per block, set by the ctor at
       obj+0x168. Every transition, in both directions, becomes that ramp.

       Measured, not assumed: across every pair of designs these five modes can
       produce, the interpolation path stays inside R2 AND never becomes more
       resonant than its own endpoints -- 0 excursions in 2970 ordered pairs,
       and 0 again for every design paired with this identity filler. So the
       ramp cannot ring on the way through.

       This also means the arm never writes a raw coefficient. It sets
       parameters and lets 1010music design and smooth, which keeps us out of
       the b0-versus-b2 slot-ordering question entirely. */

# the top of each block resets the count, so the previous block's pair is always
# entry 0. K reads it after the start call, keeps a smoothed per-mille load and
# a held peak, and the UI's every-tick present call draws a bar into all four
# LTDC buffers (two ARGB1555 layers x double buffer, 240x320 portrait).
# CPU Test (id 0x125, a cycle burner for calibrating the meter) was REMOVED in
# 2.3.9-chr9: on hardware a value of 56 overloaded the module and locked it up,
# and as a SAVED setting it came back at every boot. 0x125 is no longer
# registered or in the global store, so a stale `cputest` in settings.tml has

# --- N: the Character chain (opt-in test build) ---------------------------------
# Four chained Airwindows effects on the master bus -- Destruction, Drive,
# Colour, Saturation -- after the delay/reverb returns and before the master EQ
# and compressor. The DSP is C (character/character.c, compiled, reduced and
# frozen in FROZEN_C["chr"], linked here); this section adds two asm shims.
#
# The effects are ports of Airwindows plugins by Chris Johnson / airwindows,
# used under the MIT licence. Copyright (c) 2018 Chris Johnson. The full MIT
# notice -- permission notice and warranty disclaimer -- is reproduced at the
# top of character/character.c and travels with the frozen object's source.
# THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
#
# WHERE IT HOOKS. The engine block routine 0x08096530 (called once per audio
# block from 0x0809418a, inside the profiled per-block function 0x08093e48)
# sums the pads into master buffer 0, then mixes in buffer 0xd (delay return,
# `bl 0x080a3328` at 0x08096cf2) and buffer 0xe (reverb return, the same call
# at 0x08096d04), then calls the EQ chain head at engine+0x28cec (the master
# EQ, constructed with node id 0 = buffer 0), then the compressor if it is on,
# then renders the outputs. N retargets the SECOND mix call: the stock mix runs
# first, unchanged, and then the chain runs over buffer 0.
#
# THE REGISTER CONTRACT. nblock calls the original, then saves EVERYTHING the
# compiled C could change -- r0-r3, r12, lr, APSR, FPSCR, s0-s15 -- as they
# stand AFTER the original returned, and restores them before returning. So
# the caller sees exactly the original callee's register effects whatever the
# C does. nmidi does the same around chr_cc and then branches on to the next
# hook with every register as it found it (r0/r1 are the thunk's arguments).

# delay-switch CC just changed, or that an external clock let go or took
# over; drawn on the UI tick into the TOP LCD layer with the firmware's own
# 6x8 font drawn at 2x (the stock UI's size), gone 1.5 s after the last
# change; plus an "OSD: OFF/ON" Settings row (id 0x14b, default ON), saved
# like Clk Loss. chr6-8 had OFF/SMALL/LARGE and saved LARGE as 2, so every
# non-zero value is ON. The drawing and the MIDI-side bookkeeping are C
# in the Character object (character/chr_osd.h); this section adds the asm:
# the registration, the global-store entry, the Settings wrapper, the UI-tick
# shim, a recorder on the clock constructor (chained after J's, as L does),
# and two head insertions in front of hooks A and B that note a pad voice
# accepting one of the OSD's pad CCs. Every hook is a HEAD insertion: it takes
# the site and branches on to whatever was installed there (A, B, J, K, L, M
# or stock). See CHARACTER-DESIGN.md section 11 for the trace.

# --- P: Keep CCs (rc1, --v239) ----------------------------------------------------
# A "Keep CCs: OFF/ON" Settings row (id 0x166, default OFF, saved like Clk
# Loss). ON: after a preset load completes, the last value of every patch pad
# CC (79-93) received since power-on is sent again, per MIDI channel, so the
# new preset's pads take the controller's positions. Untouched (channel, CC)
# pairs are never sent, so they keep the preset's own values. Nothing else is
# ever sent: no stop CCs (120/123), no Character, EQ, compressor or delay CC.
#
# THE PATH AND THE THREAD. A real CC is parsed AND queued on the audio task:
# 0x08042464/0x08042480 call the per-block function 0x08093e48 (this =
# MANAGER) once per DMA half; it builds a 24-byte type-7 event and posts it at
# 0x08093f14 through the thunk 0x080950c0 into the key-0x400 queue at
# *(MANAGER+0xa204) + 0x127dc (64 entries, count at +0x600). The append
# (0x080a396c) has no lock, so the audio task is the only producer that cannot
# race the dispatcher; the engine routine 0x08096530, later in the same call,
# drains the UI's command ring (+0xdcd8 read / +0xdcdc write) and then
# dispatches the queues to the pads. P posts the SAME event through the SAME
# thunk from the block start (0x08093e72), before the MIDI loop and before any
# DSP: the queue then carries it to every pad on that channel, exactly as a
# live CC (two pads on a channel both take it; a pad type without that CC
# ignores it, as it would a live one).
#
# WHEN. FinalizeBankLoading 0x0807aa9c (UI thread; its two callers are the
# success paths of a load) ends by setting the engine's ready byte
# MANAGER+0xae10 to 1 (0x0807af2c); LoadBank cleared it. P wraps both calls and,
# with the row ON, bumps a load sequence. The block start then waits until the
# engine is ready AND the UI's command ring is empty -- every parameter the
# load posted has been applied -- and posts at most 16 events per block while
# the queue holds no more than 16 (real CCs share it). A new load restarts the
# replay; turning the row OFF stops it at the next block.
#
# NOTES ARE NOT CCs (rc3). Stock sends note-on/off and poly aftertouch through
# the same post at 0x08093f14 (they share the CC tail 0x08093f0c), with the note
# number in the CC slot and the raw velocity in the value slot. P's head there
# checks the type byte ([sp,#0x78], 7 = CC) and sends anything else straight to
# the stock post, so every CC hook behind it (P, N/O, F, D, C) sees CCs only.
# rc2 recorded the sequencer's note 87 as "CC 87" and replayed it as Sustain.
#
# NO POP-UPS. Replayed events never pass 0x08093f14, so the OSD sees no
# request; and while P has events in flight it sets KEEP_REPLAY, which O's pad
# recorders (hookOm) treat as "not an acceptance". A live pad CC arriving in
# that same 2.7 ms block loses only its pop-up.
#
# PRESET BPM IS A PRESET EDIT (rc2). Stock marks the preset unsaved
# (SessionMgr+0x8004) on its own edit paths; the Settings live edit (handler B)
# does not, because Settings rows are global. A Preset BPM edit there was only
# marked by the engine's tempo echo (message 0x6f, 0x08076c8c), which never
# comes when L parks the edit under a running clock: rc1's manual edits were
# not saveable with a clock. P's head at the LIVE-EDIT post site (0x0807d51c,
# only ever reached from handler B: a user's edit) sets the byte for id 0x66.
# Preset loads post the song store elsewhere (0x0807ad0e-0x0807adec, straight
# to PostSetParam) and the boot apply-all never carries 0x66 (not a global
# store entry), so neither marks anything.

# --- Clip Tempo (2.3.10, --comp-types): Vinyl on a Clip pad -------------------------
# CC 112 on a pad's own channel steps that Clip pad Off <-> Vinyl: its read rate
# times F x BPM / (T x 3000 x sr), so the loop is the right length for the bar and
# Clip Sync stops jumping (character/clip_tempo.h has the maths;
# CLIP-STRETCH-FEASIBILITY.md section 1.5 the stock timing). Three sites, all
# shims in hook N's 2.3.10 variant (N is built with the C, so it knows its
# addresses), installed here because two of them depend on hooks B and P:
#   - the pitch factor: `vldr s16, [r4, #0x18]` at 0x080b57f6 in the segment
#     renderer, straight after the exp2 lookup (bl at 0x080b57f2) and before it is
#     copied to s17 and multiplied into both rate paths (0x080b580a, 0x080b5868,
#     0x080b59e4), the last slice's hold recompute included. LR is free there (the
#     function pushed it), the flags are dead (the next orrs sets them).
#   - CC 112: hook B's exit when no arm matched (fB, `b.w 0x080b7554`, the voice's
#     event loop); r3 still holds the CC number (0x080b7cc4 ldrb r3, [sp, #0x34]),
#     the value is at [sp, #0x38], r4 the voice and r9 the clock (hook B notes).
#   - preset loads: both FinalizeBankLoading sites, which hook P has already
#     wrapped (pfinal); nfinal calls pfinal, then clip_loaded clears the modes
#     unless Keep CCs is ON.
# b8 adds Manual (CC 113: the pad follows Preset BPM, free of the clock's grid),
# CC 114 (Preset BPM 1-255 in steps of 2), and:
#   - the Beat Count read: `ldr.w r3, [sl, #0xb80]` at 0x080b42ac in the clip
#     timing 0x080b40fc (sl = the voice, fp = the clock). Both its paths use r3
#     (cbz-like test at 0x080b42b2, the beat count at 0x080b44a2), so nclip_beats
#     returns the count in r3 and leaves every other register as it was. In
#     Vinyl and Manual it is a count made once at Preset BPM, so stock's Auto
#     guess at the CURRENT tempo cannot halve or double the loop.
#   - Preset BPM's range: the registration's min and max (0x0806a8b6, 0x0806a8b2)
#     become 1 and 255, and hook L's HOLD capture clamps to the same.

# --- GR: Gate Rec and Gate Clr (fork feature, --gate-rec) ---------------------
# Two Settings rows on page 3, beside Theme: "Gate Rec:" and "Gate Clr:", each
# OFF or IN 1 ... IN 8. A gate on the chosen jack does what MIDI Rec's action
# notes do -- 103 records into the selected pad (it must be empty), 104 clears
# the selected pad -- and that jack stops triggering its own pad. Recording
# ends the way the MIDI note ends it: the same gate again, the Length set on the
# record page, or STOP. This is a looper's foot switch on a gate.
#
# The firmware already has every piece; GR only routes a gate to it:
#   - A gate on an input reaches the pad router (FUN_080abd2c, the engine's
#     per-block event loop) as event 0x42 (on) / 0x43 (off) for that input's pad
#     cell. The input sampler queues it as engine command 0x33 / 0x34 on the
#     threshold crossing (0x080468be / 0x080469ac); touches and MIDI notes reach
#     pads by other events, so 0x42 / 0x43 mean "a gate".
#   - The router's case 0x42 opens `cmp.w r8, #0x13` at 0x080ac022 and case
#     0x43 the same at 0x080abfe6; r8 = row*5 + col of the event's key. GR takes
#     both: a cell that is a Gate Rec / Gate Clr jack posts the action and goes
#     back to the loop head (0x080abd58, where every case ends); any other cell
#     runs the displaced compare and carries on exactly as stock. Swallowing the
#     0x43 too means a jack given to GR never releases its pad either.
#   - Which cell a jack drives is the stock table at 0x2402df44 (words, jack
#     0..7 -> cell), read live: the router's own literal 0x080ac0d4 and the
#     initialiser's 0x080ac90c both point at it.
#   - The action is the MIDI note-action event exactly as MIDI Rec builds it at
#     0x080aba6e-0x080aba92: a zeroed 0x18-byte frame, type 0x2d at +0, the
#     incoming event's +4 word at +4, the note at +8, pushed with 0x080a396c
#     onto root + 0x15288 (the router's r6 is that root; it posts there itself).
#     The router's case 0x42 already uses sp+0x48 as its scratch frame.
# Stock's own "Gate Funct: Record" (id 0xeb, never on a Micro screen) is a
# per-pad flag the router clears whenever the pad reloads, so it cannot carry a
# Clear, or survive the recording it starts; GR leaves it alone.
#
# Saved settings, as Keep CCs and Theme: two enums (ids 0x1a1 and 0x1a3:
# unregistered in stock, and neither appears as an immediate anywhere in its
# code), global-store entries defaulting to OFF so settings.tml carries them as
# `gaterecin` / `gateclrin`, and a catch on the apply-all and live-edit posts
# that keeps the value in patch RAM instead of posting it to the engine. The
# words there carry a magic in the top half, so stale RAM after a reset reads
# as OFF until the boot apply-all writes them.
