# Bitbox Micro Firmware: Settings

Six of the patch's additions live on the module's own Settings screen, not on a
CC. Set them once and they stay set, through preset changes and power cycles.
Preset BPM is the exception: it belongs to each preset, and saves with it.

Press TOOLS once to open Settings. Turn the top knob to pick a row and the
bottom knob to change it. Scroll past MIDI Keys and you reach these rows, in
this order:

```text
MIDI Rec:    1010music's, unchanged
ProgChange:  OFF / ON / NEW ONLY
Clk Loss:    INTERNAL / HOLD
Preset BPM:  40 to 250
SD Mode:     1010music's, unchanged
Flip UI:     OFF / ON
OSD:         OFF / POP-UP / CPU / BOTH
Keep CCs:    OFF / ON
```

## OSD

This row turns on the pop-up, the CPU bar, or both. They appear on top of
whichever screen you are on.

- OFF: neither.
- POP-UP: the pop-up only. This is the default.
- CPU: the bar only.
- BOTH: the pop-up and the bar.

Both turn upside down with Flip UI.

### The Pop-Up

Send any of the patch's CCs, except the pad stop, and a box opens in the middle
of the screen. The top line says where: the Character bank and its effect, `EQ`
and its mode, `COMPRESSOR`, `DELAY`, or a pad's channel. The bottom line says
what changed and its new value, in real units: hertz, decibels, milliseconds,
percent, or a name. It closes about a second and a half after you stop turning.

This is where to look. The module's own pages do not move for a CC.

Pad pop-ups name the MIDI channel, as in `CH 3`, not the pad, because every pad
on that channel takes the CC. Give each pad its own channel and the channel
names the pad. A pad pop-up appears only when a pad on that channel took the CC.
No pop-up means no pad there answers it. See
[when a control seems dead](CC-REFERENCE.md#when-a-control-seems-dead).

The clock has pop-ups too: `CLOCK OFF` when an external clock stops, with the
tempo the module is holding or falling back to, `Synced` when one takes over,
and `Tempo` when it settles on a new tempo.

No pop-up opens for the value already showing, a preset load, or the values
Keep CCs puts back.

### The CPU Bar

A bar along the bottom of the screen shows how hard the processor is working. It
is green, then amber from about 70%, then red from about 90%. Use it to see what
the Character chain costs before you hear it.

![The CPU bar at three loads, stacked: green only at a light load, green into
amber at about 78%, and on into red at about 95%. A white tick marks the
recent peak.](cpu-bar.png)

From the top, the bars show a light load, a load into the amber and one into
the red. The white tick is the recent peak.

## Preset BPM

Set a preset's tempo on the module and save it with the preset. That was never
possible before. The only way was to edit the preset file on a computer.

### Using It

Pick a tempo from 40 to 250 BPM, then save the preset. It loads at that tempo
from then on. Each preset can have its own.

This is the tempo the module runs at when no clock is driving it. Synced delays
and LFOs follow it. Most presets sit at 120 only because nothing on the module
could change it.

### With a Clock

A running clock always sets the tempo. Change Preset BPM while one is running
and you hear no change yet. Your tempo takes over when the clock stops, and it
saves with the preset as normal.

### Capturing a Tempo

With Clk Loss on HOLD, stop or unplug the clock and the tempo it was running at
is copied into Preset BPM. Save the preset to keep it. Changing Preset BPM by
hand ends a hold.

## Keep CCs

Loading a preset puts every pad back the way it was saved. Keep CCs keeps the
changes you made from your controller instead.

Say your vocal pad is on channel 6 and you have pushed its delay and reverb
sends up for the last chorus. Load the next preset and both sends drop back to
their saved values. With Keep CCs ON, the new preset's channel 6 pad comes up
with the sends where you left them.

It covers the per-pad controls this patch adds: the sends, Reverse, Sustain,
the loop, granular and LFO controls. Only the ones you have moved since
power-on carry over. The rest load as saved.

OFF is the default: presets load exactly as saved.

## Clk Loss

Clk Loss keeps the tempo when the clock goes away.

### What It Fixes

Unplug an external clock, or let it stop sending, and after about five seconds
the module falls back to the preset's own tempo. Every beat-synced delay and LFO
jumps with it.

HOLD stops the jump. The module carries on at the last tempo the clock gave it.

- INTERNAL: what the module has always done. This is the default.
- HOLD: keep the last external tempo until a clock returns.

Set the fallback tempo with the Preset BPM row above.

### What HOLD Keeps Through

A held tempo survives loading another preset, by Program Change or from the
panel. It survives Stop and Start too.

A returning clock always takes over, at whatever tempo it now runs. So does a
second clock source that is still running.

Power off and the held tempo is gone, unless you saved the preset while it was
holding. HOLD itself stays set. The module starts at the preset's tempo until a
clock arrives.

Switching to INTERNAL while holding takes effect at the next Start, locate or
preset load, not at once.

## Flip UI

Flip UI is for a module mounted upside down. It turns the screen, touch, buttons
and knobs the other way up, all together.

### What Turns

- Screen: rotated half a turn.
- Touch: follows the screen, so a tap lands on what is under your finger.
- Buttons: swap ends, so each sits where it should.
- Knobs: swap jobs. Turning direction is unchanged.

The knob swap happens the moment you change the setting. The knob you just used
starts doing the other job. Expect it.

### What Stays Put

The faceplate printing stays the right way up for a normal mount. So does the
bootloader's screen while flashing. One owner turned the buttons round inside
the module so their labels read correctly upside down. That is hardware work.
Do it at your own risk.

At power-on the splash and first screen appear the normal way up for about a
second, then turn. Nothing is wrong. The module draws them before it has read
the setting from the card.

## ProgChange

Stock firmware offers OFF and ON. The patch adds a third choice.

### NEW ONLY

- OFF: ignore Program Change.
- ON: always load, even the preset already playing, as stock firmware does.
- NEW ONLY: skip a request for the preset already loaded.

Some sequencers resend the same Program Change every time a pattern starts. With
ON, each repeat reloads the preset and swallows the first notes. NEW ONLY lets
the repeats go by. A different preset still loads.

Going from A to B and back to A works. So does loading B from the panel and
then sending A. After you rename the current preset or use Save As, the first
request reloads it once. Choose ON when you want a resend to reload a preset
you have just edited.

Program Change still answers on the MIDI Pads and MIDI Keys channels, as before.
