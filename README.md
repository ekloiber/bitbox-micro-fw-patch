# Bitbox Micro, Unlocked

> **This is a fork** of
> [modularpatcher/bitbox-micro-fw-patch](https://github.com/modularpatcher/bitbox-micro-fw-patch).
> It adds Gate Rec and Gate Clr rows to the Settings screen, so a gate can
> record into or clear the selected pad (see
> [Settings](SETTINGS.md#gate-rec-and-gate-clr)). `--gate-rec` adds them to the
> full patch; `--gate-only` adds them to stock 2.3.4 and nothing else. Without
> either flag it builds exactly the same image as upstream. Questions about the fork's feature belong
> here, not upstream and not with 1010music.

The Bitbox Micro hides most of its controls behind the screen. This patch puts
them on MIDI and adds what the module never had:

- A jungle toolkit for Clip pads: loops that stretch to your tempo with an
  early-'90s sampler's grain, 24 Live Flip modes to re-cut them live, and turntable
  moves on hold buttons.
- Airwindows effects across the whole mix: four slots, sixteen effects.
- A master EQ and filter, and four compressors, three of them Airwindows.
- Per-pad sends, envelope, LFO, loop and granular controls.
- A pop-up showing what every CC just changed, and screen themes.

It is unofficial. Nobody at 1010music wrote or endorsed it, so do not ask them
for support. The splash reads `community fw`, so a patched unit is never
mistaken for theirs. Assume it affects your warranty. It
[cannot brick the module](INSTALLING.md#can-this-brick-my-module), though.

## A Patcher, Not Firmware

You download a script, not firmware. It edits your own copy of stock 2.3.4, on
your own machine, and refuses anything else. Nobody here has 1010music's code
to distribute.

There is one rule: **never pass a patched image on**. Send people this page
instead, and let them build their own.

## Quick Start

You need a Bitbox Micro on firmware 2.3.4, Python 3 and a microSD card. Get
[`patch_micro.py`](patch_micro.py), and `MICRO234.zip` from 1010music. Run the
script on the zip and copy the result to your card. The splash should then read
`community fw`. [Installing](INSTALLING.md) has every step.

## Licence

The patcher and this guide are MIT-licensed. The firmware is 1010music's. No
permission over it is granted. Bitbox Micro is a product of 1010music LLC, named
only to say what hardware this runs on. The Character chain's effects are ports
of Chris Johnson's Airwindows plugins, under their own MIT licence. If you paid
for this, somebody sold you something they did not write.

Flash stock firmware back before you send a unit for service. See
[LICENSE](LICENSE) for the rest.

## AI Assistance

Yes, AI was used. It helped read the assembly for the patch and draft this
guide, which left more hours for designing controls and testing them.

It could not decide whether any of it works. Every control was confirmed by ear,
on hardware. Judge the patch by what it does for you.

## If You're from 1010music

Thank you for the Bitbox Micro. It is a wonderful little module, and worth the
time spent inside it. No firmware of yours is included, in any form. Everybody
downloads it from your site, under your terms, and the script refuses anything
else. What ships is one Python file, a guide, and an MIT licence covering only
those. The splash reads `community fw`, and anyone with a problem is told to
flash your firmware back before contacting you.

## Getting Help

There is no support. It is one person's patch, given away as is. Ask
questions in Discussions on the GitHub page you downloaded it from. Report a
fault there as an issue, with the steps that cause it. Other users answer too.
You can also ask in
[the Mod Wiggler thread](https://www.modwiggler.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=302078),
r/modular or r/eurorack, where other users run the same controls on the same
numbers. Please do not take questions to 1010music's Discord. It is not their
work.
