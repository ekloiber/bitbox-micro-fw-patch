# Changelog

Changes to the Bitbox Micro firmware patch, newest first. Each entry describes
something you would notice: what the module does differently once it is
flashed, what the patcher does differently to your files, or what changed in
the guide you are reading. None of them covers how any of it is built.

## 2.3.9-mod — October 2026

- Sixteen Airwindows effects on the master bus, and a pop-up that shows what
  every CC in the patch just did.
- The Character chain: four effect slots across the whole mix, each with an
  Amount, a Tone and four effects. Ports of Chris Johnson's Airwindows
  plugins, described in depth on
  [the Airwindows site](https://www.airwindows.com/).
  - Destruction, lo-fi and breakage: Pockey2, DeRez3, Ring Mod, Fracture2.
  - Overdrive, warm tube to dirty harmonics: Tube2, Drive, Mackity, Huge.
  - Colour, consoles, tape and a transformer: Channel9, IronOxide5, ToTape8,
    Coils2.
  - Saturation, smooth weight and density: PurestDrive, Spiral2, Density3,
    Mojo.
- Pop-ups: every patch CC shows what it changed, in real units. The clock gets
  them too.
- A CPU bar along the bottom of the screen, and a new OSD row that picks the
  pop-ups, the bar, both or neither.
- Preset BPM: set a preset's tempo on the module and save it with the preset.
  With Clk Loss on HOLD, it also captures a clock's tempo.
- Auto makeup for the compressor on CC 46, so the peaks stay level as you
  compress harder.
- Keep CCs, a Settings row that puts your per-pad CCs back after a preset load.
- Fixed: MIDI notes could change compressor, EQ or delay settings.
- Fixed in the guide: the EQ comes before the compressor, not after it.
- Everything from 2.3.8-mod is unchanged and still there.

## 2.3.8-mod — October 2026

- Three new rows on the module's own Settings screen, the first additions that
  are not on a CC.
- Flip UI turns the screen, touch, buttons and knobs over together, for a
  module mounted upside down.
- Clk Loss keeps the last tempo when the clock drops out, instead of falling
  back to 120. Beat-synced delays and LFOs stay where they were, through preset
  changes, until a clock returns.
- ProgChange gains NEW ONLY, which ignores a Program Change for the preset
  already loaded. A sequencer that resends the same request every pattern no
  longer reloads the preset and swallows its first notes.
- All three are on page 2 of TOOLS, Settings, and the module saves them with its
  own settings. A new settings page in the guide covers each one.
- Everything from 2.3.7-mod is unchanged and still there.

## 2.3.7-mod — September 2026

- A master EQ and filter, which the module has never had. Ten algorithms: a DJ filter, a dual
  cut, a band pass, a three-band mixer EQ, tone and filter together, a tilt, a
  notch, a peak, a phaser, and a formant filter.
- The installation and user guide has been completely redeveloped, hopefully
  making it easier to take in, and easier to reach just the part you need.
- Every control is neutral at its centre in every mode, so three centred knobs
  is an EQ doing nothing at all, and the mode dial can be swept without hearing
  it.
- Sixteen of the encoder pushes do something. A kill takes a range out of the
  mix, an open lets a band stop acting, a slam forces a control to its maximum.
  All of them momentary, and letting go hands back the knob's own position
  without a jump.
- A master bypass on CC 57 takes the whole thing out, and puts it back.
- Nine CCs, 50 to 57 and 59, on MIDI channel 1 beside the compressor.
- Everything from 2.3.6-mod is unchanged and still there.

## 2.3.6-mod — September 2026

- The module's master bus compressor is now reachable over MIDI. All five
  parameters that were previously fixed and invisible are on the table:
  Threshold, Ratio, Attack, Release and Makeup gain.
- It arrives configured as a glue compressor, close to a classic SSL-style bus
  compressor recipe — 2:1 ratio, a slow 30 ms attack, a 300 ms release — ready
  to use with no setup, and adjustable from there.
- The compressor answers on MIDI channel 1 only, on CC 40 through 45: the five
  parameters, plus on/off on CC 40. The rest of the patch is per-pad, on each
  pad's own channel. That is deliberate, so a stray message from elsewhere in a
  rack cannot move it by accident.
- Everything from 2.3.5-mod is unchanged and still there.

## 2.3.5-mod — August 2026

- Per-pad Delay send and Reverb send, so each pad can sit in its own place in
  the mix rather than sharing one blend across the whole preset.
- Per-pad Reverse.
- Per-pad Envelope Sustain, later extended to reach Clip and Slicer pads as
  well as the sample-based ones.
- Per-pad Loop Mode and Loop Crossfade.
- Five granular controls that had no way to be touched before: Density, Grain
  Size, Window, Scatter and Pan Random.
- Global delay Beat Sync, Ping-Pong, Filter and Filter Width, shared across the
  whole preset.
- LFO Wave, Beat Sync and Retrigger, reaching every pad type — Sample,
  Multi-Sample, Clip, Slicer and Granular — not only the ones that had them at
  first.
- Per-pad stop for long clips, one pad at a time. Stopping a pad now releases
  the voice rather than cutting it dead.
- The whole control set was regrouped onto a cleaner CC map, so some numbers
  moved even where the control itself did not change.
- The splash screen stopped crediting 1010music on a patched image.
- The patcher stopped being able to overwrite a user's own stock firmware
  file.
- The Scatter control's threshold now reads on the scale people actually
  think in, rather than an internal one.
