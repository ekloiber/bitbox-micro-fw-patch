# Bitbox Micro Firmware: Installing

This page takes you from a stock 2.3.4 download to a module running the patch.
See [the overview](README.md) for what the patch does.

## Prerequisites

You need five things, none of them exotic.

- A **Bitbox Micro** running firmware **2.3.4**.
- [`patch_micro.py`](patch_micro.py), the patcher itself.
- Your own copy of the stock 2.3.4 image, from
  <https://1010music.com/downloads> → bitbox micro → **`MICRO234.zip`**. The
  script will not run without it, and none of it ships here.
- **Python 3**, any version from the last several years. There is nothing to
  compile or configure. See [Getting Python](#getting-python).
- A microSD card the module can read. Any working card will flash. If you are
  buying one anyway, **V30** is the rating worth having for streaming samples
  while you play.

Do two things first:

1. **Keep the stock `MICRO.BIN`**, and keep 1010music's `MICRO234.zip` too.
   It is how you go back, and the script needs it again every time you re-patch.
2. **Back up your SD card.** The patch never touches your presets or
   samples. Back it up anyway.

### Presets That Use It

There is nothing to set up on the module. The controls work on every preset,
and you set your controller to send their CCs. An old preset can only give back
what it was built to do, though. See
[Building a Preset for This](PAD-CONTROLS.md#building-a-preset-for-this).

## Preparing

Download the firmware from 1010music yourself, under their terms, and unzip it.
You get `MICRO.BIN`. The version is in the zip's name, not the file's, so label
your copies.

If you already run an earlier version of this patch, patch your stock
`MICRO.BIN` again, not the image you flashed last time. The script refuses a
file that has already been through it. If you no longer have the stock file,
download `MICRO234.zip` again.

It also refuses a wrong firmware version, a file whose code is not exactly what
it expects, and an output path that would overwrite your stock copy. Each one
stops it before a single byte is written.

### Getting Python

> **Windows**: install it from <https://www.python.org/downloads/>. On the
> installer's first screen, tick "Add python.exe to PATH" before you click
> Install. Older installers call the same box "Add Python to PATH". It is
> easy to click straight past. If you miss it, see *Windows Cannot Find Python*
> below.

> **macOS**: it is usually there already. The first time you type `python3`,
> macOS may offer to install its command line tools. Say yes. It is a big
> download, so give it a few minutes. It has not hung.

> **Linux**: it is already there. If a minimal install left it out, your package
> manager has it under the name `python3`.

You run the script from a terminal, in the folder that contains
`patch_micro.py` and `MICRO.BIN`.

Getting the terminal into that folder:

- Windows: open the folder in File Explorer, click into the address bar at
  the top, type `cmd` over what is there, and press Enter. PowerShell works
  the same way.
- macOS: open Terminal, type `cd ` (with the space), then drag the folder
  from Finder onto the Terminal window and press Enter. It fills in the path
  for you.
- Linux: most file managers have "Open Terminal Here" on the right-click
  menu. The macOS drag trick works in most terminals too.

## Building

Enter the commands one line at a time, pressing Enter after each. Do not
double-click `patch_micro.py`. That only opens it in a text editor, or flashes a
window open and shut.

On Windows:

```sh
mkdir patched
python patch_micro.py MICRO.BIN patched/MICRO.BIN
```

The forward slash is right on Windows too.

On macOS and Linux, the command is `python3`:

```sh
mkdir patched
python3 patch_micro.py MICRO.BIN patched/MICRO.BIN
```

If you have patched before, `mkdir patched` says the folder already exists.
That is fine. Carry on.

If you get a long line saying it cannot open `patch_micro.py`, ending in
`[Errno 2] No such file or directory`, the terminal is not in the folder with
those two files. Nothing is broken. Go back to *Getting the terminal into that
folder* above and try again.

The patched image must be named exactly `MICRO.BIN`, in upper case, or the
module will not find it. It goes in its own folder so it cannot overwrite your
stock copy, which is your way back. The script refuses if you try to write
over it.

That file is yours alone. Do not pass it on. See
[A Patcher, Not Firmware](README.md#a-patcher-not-firmware).

You should see something like this:

  Done. MICRO.BIN is ready -- 722,140 bytes.

     Fingerprint  155b1f254bf93967cdd43ac9154e99e602d6619390e18180717586222919d478
```

Check that the fingerprint matches the one above. If it does, your firmware is
byte-for-byte the same as everyone else's running this patch.

Add `-v` to see every change it makes.

## Flashing

1. Copy `patched/MICRO.BIN` to the **root** of the microSD card, not inside a
   folder. Leave your stock copy where it is. It is how you go back.
2. Power the module off and insert the card.
3. Hold the **white right-arrow** button while powering on.
4. Release when the display shows *Erasing* / *Programming*. It takes about
   15 seconds.

Do not interrupt the power while it is writing.

## Checking It Worked

The splash on the next boot should read:

```text
bitbox micro
community fw
2.3.9-mod
```

If it still says `by 1010music` and `2.3.4`, nothing was flashed. Check that
the file is named `MICRO.BIN` and sits in the card root. Then try again.

Check the splash after every flash. It takes a second, and it saves you chasing
a CC on firmware that was never installed.

Then send one of the patch's CCs. A pop-up in the middle of the screen should
name what it changed. That proves the patch is running and your controller is
getting through. The [CC reference](CC-REFERENCE.md) has the full list, and
[Settings](SETTINGS.md) covers the new rows on the Settings screen.

## If Something Goes Wrong

### Windows Cannot Find Python

Two things can happen here. Neither means you broke anything.

#### The Microsoft Store Opens Instead of Running Anything

Python is not installed yet. Take the Store's copy, or install from python.org
as above. Either works.

#### It Says 'python' Is Not Recognized

Python is installed, but the "Add python.exe to PATH" tickbox was missed.
Before you reinstall anything, try `py` instead of `python`:

```sh
py patch_micro.py MICRO.BIN patched/MICRO.BIN
```

`py` comes with Python and usually works when `python` does not, whether or
not you ticked that box.

If `py` does not work either, install Python again from
<https://www.python.org/downloads/> and tick "Add python.exe to PATH" this
time. Nothing is wrong with the script or your download.

### If It Stops with an Error

That is the safety check working. It tells you what it found and what it
expected, and it has written nothing.

- *"That is not the stock 2.3.4 firmware"*: the input is a different version, an
  already patched image, or a truncated download. If you are upgrading from an
  earlier version of this patch, you have almost certainly pointed it at the
  image you flashed last time. Patch your original `MICRO.BIN` again, the one
  straight out of `MICRO234.zip`. You cannot upgrade a patched image in place.
  Download `MICRO234.zip` from 1010music again if you no longer have it.
- *"The code at … is not what it should be"*: the file passes the checksum, but
  the code underneath is wrong, which should be impossible. Do not force it.

The script checks everything before it writes anything, so there is no such
thing as a half-patched file.

### Going Back to Stock

Rename your original 1010music download to `MICRO.BIN`, put it in the card
root, and follow the same flashing steps. The module overwrites the patched
image with it and forgets any of this happened.

## Can This Brick My Module?

No, it cannot. Firmware is flashed by the bootloader, a separate program in its
own region of flash. It is not in the file you patch, and the patch never writes
near it. You start it by holding a button at power-on, before any firmware runs.
Even a completely broken image cannot stop you flashing a good one.

At worst, the module boots oddly, or not at all. Hold the white right-arrow,
flash the stock image back, and two minutes later you are where you started.

The one real risk is losing power during the 15-second write, the same as with
an official 1010music update. Even then the bootloader survives, so you just try
again. Do not flash from a laptop that is about to sleep, or on a power supply
you do not trust.

## When New Firmware Lands

The patcher will refuse it. Its changes are specific to 2.3.4, and on another
build they would land somewhere else entirely. Do not work around the version
check. Someone has to redo the reverse engineering first.
