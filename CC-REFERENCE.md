# Bitbox Micro Firmware: CC Reference

This page lists every CC, its channel and the pad types that answer it, and what
to check when one seems dead. [Pad controls](PAD-CONTROLS.md) says what each one
does, [Clip modes](CLIP-MODES.md) covers the Clip pad's tempo, Live Flip modes and
hold buttons, and [devices](DEVICES.md) covers the three that act on the whole
mix.

## Which CC, Which Channel

**Multi-Sample**: this is a Sample pad with a folder of WAVs loaded into it, not
a separate mode, so it behaves exactly like a Sample pad. Switch it to another
mode and it plays only the first file.

The gaps are the module's, not the patch's:

- **Reverse**: Clip and Slicer pads have no reverse setting.
- **Play Through**: Slicer pads only, since only they have slices.
- **Loop Mode and Loop Crossfade**: Clip and Slicer pads loop their own way,
  with no equivalent setting.
- **Recorded-sample pads**: these have no FX sends in stock firmware. The delay
  and reverb knobs on the FX screen do nothing on them either.

Sustain and the LFO controls work on Clip and Slicer pads too.

The three devices are not in the table. They act on every pad routed to Out 1/2,
whatever its type.

There is nothing to set up on the module. Each control has a fixed CC that works
on every preset, with no MIDI Learn and no modulation slot. Set your controller
to send these CCs on the channel shown and you are playing. Every one but the
pad stop opens a [pop-up](SETTINGS.md#the-pop-up).

### Which Channel to Send On

- **CC 79 to 93, and 120/123**: per pad. Send them on the channel the pad
  listens on, the one you trigger it with. Eight pads on eight channels answer
  independently.
- **CC 78, 102, 104, 105, 107 and 112 to 119**: the [Clip modes](CLIP-MODES.md),
  per Clip pad, on its channel in the same way.
- **CC 108 to 111**: the delay, which the whole preset shares. Send them on
  any channel.
- **CC 14 to 29**: the [Character chain](CHARACTER.md), channel 1 only.
- **CC 40 to 48**: the [compressor](COMPRESSOR.md), channel 1 only. All four
  types share CC 41–45. Each uses them differently.
- **CC 50 to 57, and 59**: the [EQ and filter](EQ-FILTER.md), channel 1 only.

If a device ignores everything, put your controller on MIDI channel 1.

## Setting Up Your Controller

Do this once. Every preset behaves the same after that.

### Recommended Controller

The per-pad CCs go out on each pad's own channel, so your controller must set
the MIDI channel per control, not just per device. Many cannot.

The **[Neuzeit Instruments Drop](https://www.neuzeit-instruments.com/products/drop/)**
can. Each control sends on its device's default channel or on any channel you
pick. One Drop device slot covers all eight pads plus the global controls,
leaving the other seven slots free. Any controller that sets the channel per
control works as well.

### Encoder Types

The **Encoder** column in the [MIDI CC map](#midi-cc-map) suggests how to set up
each control. It changes the feel, not what the module does. Almost everything
wants a plain linear encoder. These are the exceptions:

**Attack and Release**: use a curve that **starts gradually and then ramps up**,
so the useful fast settings are not crammed into the first few percent. Vendors
name it differently, so go by shape. On the Drop it is **Exponential minus**.
The plus variant makes the crowding worse. At halfway, Attack should send about
`8` and Release about `12`. If either sends about `64`, the curve is still
linear.

**Ratio**: linear is fine. The musical settings sit low, though, with 2:1 at
about 5% and 4:1 at about 16%, so move slowly down there.

**Loop Mode, LFO Wave and Character pick effect**: these are lists, not sweeps.
Use a stepped encoder with exactly this many steps. Any other count skips
entries or hits one twice.

| Control | Steps | The list |
| ------- | ----- | -------- |
| **Loop Mode** | **3** | None / Forward / Bidirectional |
| **LFO Wave** | **10** | the ten waveforms, in the module's order |
| **Character pick effect** | **4** | the bank's four effects, in order |

Without stepped encoders, a slow linear sweep still works. Find the bands by
ear.

**Switches**: set up anything marked `≥64 on` as a button sending 0 and 127.

### Getting the Full Range

This is about CCs you map yourself in a preset. The patch's own CCs always
cover their full range.

A CC mapped **through a preset** moves its parameter *upward from the saved
value*. Save a parameter halfway and the CC only reaches the top half. It looks
exactly like a broken mapping.

Before you save, set each parameter you will drive to its **minimum**:

| Parameter | Set it to |
| --- | --- |
| Delay time, Beat Sync on | `1/64`, the first entry |
| Delay time, Beat Sync off | `0%` |
| Delay feedback | `0` |
| Delay cutoff | `0`, and see the note below |
| Reverb decay, damping, pre-delay | `0` |

Delay cutoff's minimum, `0`, means fully low-passed, though the screen shows it
as negative. The delay sounds very dark until the CC brings it up.

Your preset will sound different before any MIDI arrives. Feedback at zero is a
single slap, not a delay. Do this only for parameters you really will drive.

### Use 14-Bit CC

Use it for CCs you map yourself in a preset, such as filter cutoff and
resonance. The module still lands on only 128 positions, because it discards
the second half of the pair. But a 14-bit sweep sends far fewer messages, so the
parameter moves smoothly instead of lurching.

Keep the patch's CCs **7-bit**. A 14-bit pair sends its second half 32 numbers
higher. Something else lives there. For the Character chain, that is auto makeup
or the EQ. For CC 50, it is a pad's granular window. Granular Density's second
half lands on the delay's filter width, and Loop Crossfade's on Reset All
Controllers.

## When a Control Seems Dead

Two tests settle most cases. Look for the pop-up, then try the encoder. Things
the module cannot do are in [limitations](LIMITATIONS.md).

### Is There a Pop-Up?

A pad pop-up appears only when a pad on that channel took the CC. If none
appears, check the channel. Then check the pad type. For the three devices, no
pop-up means nothing arrived on channel 1.

A pop-up with no sound means the CC arrived and the cause is elsewhere, such as
an LFO pointed at nothing, or Scatter with Density up.

No pop-up opens for the value already showing, or with the OSD row on OFF or
CPU.

### Does the Encoder Do It?

Turn the parameter by hand. If the encoder changes it, your MIDI is fine.
The fault is elsewhere. If it does not, the module cannot do it, and no MIDI
will change that. The stop pair, CC 120 and 123, is the one control with no
encoder.
