# Bitbox Micro Firmware: The Compressor

Your Bitbox has always had a bus compressor across Out 1 and 2, but the module
only lets you switch it on and off. Threshold, ratio, attack, release and makeup
gain were fixed. This patch puts all five on MIDI, adds auto makeup, and starts
you on a classic glue setting.

## Where It Sits

It acts on the whole Out 1/2 mix, delay and reverb returns included, after the
Character chain and the EQ. See [where they sit](DEVICES.md#where-they-sit).
Pads on Out 3–6 skip it, and that comes in useful below.

## How a Compressor Works

Here it is in one line:

> A compressor turns the loud parts down, then you turn the whole thing back up.
> The result is a smaller gap between loud and quiet, which sounds denser,
> steadier, and louder at the same peak level.

## What Each Control Does

- **Threshold**: how loud a sound has to get before the compressor acts. Bring
  it down and more of the music gets caught.
- **Ratio**: how hard it clamps above the threshold. At 2:1, a sound 10 dB over
  comes out 5 dB over. At 10:1 it comes out 1 dB over. Low ratios shape. High
  ratios flatten.
- **Attack**: how quickly it reacts. Fast attacks squash the front of a hit.
  Slow attacks let it through first, which keeps drums punchy.
- **Release**: how quickly it lets go. Short releases pump and breathe. Long
  releases are smoother.
- **Makeup gain**: how much level you put back afterwards.

## How It Arrives

Switch it on and you get glue: gentle bus compression that pulls a mix together.
The starting values are close to the classic SSL bus compressor setting.

| Control | Starts at | Which is |
| ------- | --------- | -------- |
| **Threshold** | 70% | −12 dB |
| **Ratio** | 5% | 2:1 |
| **Attack** | 30% | 30 ms |
| **Release** | 29% | 300 ms |
| **Makeup gain** | 50% | 0 dB |

The slow 30 ms attack matters most. It lets the front of every kick and snare
through before the compressor clamps. That is the difference between glue and
mush.

How much it does depends on how loud your mix is:

| If your mix peaks around | You get |
| --- | --- |
| −1 dBFS (hot) | about 5–6 dB of gain reduction — firm, still musical |
| −6 dBFS (sensible headroom) | about 3 dB — textbook glue |
| −12 dBFS | nothing |
| quieter than that | nothing at all |

Aim for peaks around **−6 dBFS** going in. Makeup starts at 0 dB, so switching
on can only make things slightly quieter, never louder. Once you like the
threshold, bring makeup up until the compressor sounds equally loud on and
bypassed. Match the levels first. Then compare.

If your mix runs much hotter, the compressor works harder and you will want
more makeup. If it runs cold, bring the threshold down rather than reaching for
makeup.

## Glue on a Button

If your controller can send several CCs from one button, set one up to send
these six. Then experiment as much as you like. One press brings the glue back.

| Send | CC | Value | Which is |
| ---- | -- | ----- | -------- |
| **Compressor on** | 40 | `127` | on |
| **Threshold** | 41 | `90` | −12 dB |
| **Ratio** | 42 | `7` | 2:1 |
| **Attack** | 43 | `38` | 30 ms |
| **Release** | 44 | `37` | 300 ms |
| **Makeup gain** | 45 | `64` | 0 dB |

Send all six on MIDI channel 1. Include CC 40. Without it, a press can restore
five settings into a compressor that is still off, and you hear nothing change.

Set the button to **momentary, not toggle**. Some controllers call it temporary
or trigger. A latching button holds its values, and your encoders cannot move
them.

After a press, the module sits on the glue values while your encoders are
wherever you left them. Turn one and the parameter jumps to meet it. If your
controller offers pickup, also called soft takeover or catch, switch it on for
these five. Each encoder then waits until it passes the module's value.

To hear what your module did before you patched it, set up a second button:
threshold `115`, ratio `20`, attack `12`, release `31`, makeup `57`. That is
−4 dB, 4:1, 10 ms, 250 ms and −4 dB of makeup. It is a headroom trim, not a
musical setting.

## Auto Makeup

Auto makeup sets the makeup for you, so the peaks stay at the level they went
in. Pull the threshold down and the mix gets denser, not quieter. CC 46 on
channel 1 switches it: `≥64` is on and `<64` is off. It is off at every
power-on.

While it is on, CC 45 is ignored, including the makeup a glue button sends. The
pop-up says `Makeup  Auto` if you move it. Switch auto off and the makeup stays
where auto left it until you move CC 45.

Expect a jump when you switch it on. At the starting values the level rises by
about 6 dB at once. It also sounds louder than bypassed, because matching
the peaks of a compressed mix raises its average.

## Setting It by Ear

There is no gain reduction meter. Your ears are the meter.

To find the threshold, bring it down slowly while something busy plays. At
first nothing happens. Then the loud parts start to lean back a little. Leave it
just past that point. If it sounds squashed or breathless, you have gone too
far.

The others are quicker to hear:

- **Ratio**: sweep it on a busy loop, from transparent to obviously squashed.
- **Release**: set it short on a kick loop. It should pump hard. Release is by
  far the most audible.
- **Attack**: set it long on the same loop, and the click of the kick comes
  back.
- **Makeup gain**: it changes the level, and nothing else.

## Two Things That Confuse

Nothing happens while the compressor is off. It remembers the five settings and
applies them all when you switch it on.

Makeup gain runs from −36 dB to +36 dB and starts at 0 dB, in the middle. The
bottom, −36 dB, is silence. If your encoder is parked at the bottom when you
first touch it, the sound vanishes. Nothing is broken. Turn it up to halfway.

## What It Will Not Do

There is no sidechain. The module has no key input, so you cannot duck the mix
from a kick on another channel. Bus compression with a fast attack and a loud
kick already pumps convincingly, though the kick is compressed too. If you
sequence CCs, you can also draw a threshold envelope in time with the kick.

There is no wet/dry mix either. Use the outputs instead. Put the same sample on
two pads with the same MIDI channel and Pad Note, route one to Out 1/2 and the
other to Out 3/4, and mix them outside the box. Squash the first hard and blend
it underneath. That is parallel compression, at the cost of a pad and an output
pair.

## They Last Until Power Off

The settings survive a preset change. Power-on brings back the glue values
above, with auto makeup off. See
[what they have in common](DEVICES.md#what-they-have-in-common).
